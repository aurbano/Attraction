Attraction
==========

> A little iOS visual application created with Codea (iPad app)

The program draws several balls floating in a 2D space, the color depends on each ball's speed (blue to red, as speed increases)
You can tap anywhere to create a new attraction point (white  circles) that slowly fades away until it dissappears. You can also drag attraction points to relocate them.

See a little demo of the program in action:
